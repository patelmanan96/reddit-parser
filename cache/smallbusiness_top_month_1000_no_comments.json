I\u2019m 30 now. This has been my whole professional life. \n\nMy revenue is 1.5-2M, but i only net like $$50-$100k, maybe $200k on a good year. \n\nThis sounds kinda cool but its not that great. It kinda sucks actually\n\nI risk it all every year to make less than any of my friends who just took white collar jobs who started at $100k and make like $350k+/yr now. \n\nI probably could have been one of those people, but nope i had to fulfill my dream of being a business owner. If i could just go back in time and yell at the stupid ambitious boy i used to be\n\nAnyone else ever feel this way? Just questioning everything that lead you into this life?\n\nEdit: I think i just got a growth idea. It might bankrupt me, but fuck it, could be fun. Will keep you guys posted\n\nEdit 2: I was mostly just venting but i feel like i owe you all answers to these questions i\u2019ve been asked multiple times:\n\n1. What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue.

Feel free to comment, we need the honest feedback and don't retailiate.\n\n*Edit: Sounds like voting is really going to matter even more going forward. If everyone votes post up or down as they see value I think we'll be in a good place. Personally I upvote every comment that adds value made in one of my posts whether I agree with them or not.

Working around 50-60 hours a week. I live at home and rely completely on my parents for survival. Meanwhile, the business costs around $9,500 a month just to keep open which we only make $6k gross monthly, and I have no clue how we\u2019re staying afloat. I have no equity, no benefits.just all the pressure, responsibility, and emotional weight. Just for \u201cThis is your business, not mine.\u201d\n\nI feel trapped. I care about the work and the potential this business has. I\u2019ve taught myself everything about the business and how to run all the machinery. I\u2019m exhausted, broke, and starting to resent the whole thing. I don\u2019t want to walk away from something I\u2019ve invested myself into, but I also can\u2019t keep going like this.\n\nHas anyone been through something like this\u2014especially in a family dynamic where expectations are unfair and communication is toxic? How do I navigate this without destroying my mental health or my relationship with my parents?\n\nAny advice or personal stories would be appreciated.

I work 12\u201314 hours a day, and even though I\u2019ve gotten one client and can cover my family\u2019s expenses, but I haven\u2019t gotten big results yet.\n\nThe problem is  my mom just doesn\u2019t believe in making money online. She thinks I\u2019m wasting time. She wants me to go to countries like Saudi Arabia or Qatar and work there like many others do from our part of the world. She also wants me to learn traditional skills like car driving or AC repair, even though I already know a lot about computers and editing. I get it  she\u2019s old school, and we live in a third-world country. Stability matters. But I wish she could see what I\u2019m trying to build.\n\nOn top of that, my girlfriend is losing patience. She\u2019s frustrated that I can\u2019t give her time, but I\u2019m not rich, I don\u2019t even have my own home, and I feel like I have to work harder than most to create a life where I can be proud if her parents ever ask me what I do.\n\nI\u2019m trying to get inbound clients through LinkedIn content because cold emails haven\u2019t worked for me. But everything is slow. Really slow. And it\u2019s crushing. I feel like I\u2019m trying to carry my whole world on my shoulders  and it\u2019s getting heavier every day.\n\nIf anyone\u2019s been through something like this\u2026 how did you push through it?)this early stage of building something real takes time how we can scale fast, and that it\u2019s not about overnight money, but long-term freedom?\n\nAny advice or even a few kind words would mean a lot right now.

She knows my policy yet will ask what her options are and then blast me when I give her options to her:  my class is over priced, the project isn't worth the value, she heard the class ran over by 10 minutes (not due to me), I didn't have a wine stopper for their unused wine, etc.  This last time she stated that she is also a business owner and if I don't give her a refund she will \"escalate\" this and blast me on every social site that she can find.

Launch**\n\n* Set a (soft) launch date\n* Share with your network or community\n* Ask for feedback\n* Improve as you go\n\nI\u2019m still refining this, but it\u2019s already helped a few others avoid some early missteps.\n\nIf you're in the early stages too, I\u2019d be happy to share the full template I use or answer any questions.", "is_self": true, "link_flair_text": "General"}, {"id": "1ksvnv5", "title": "Homeless Shoplifters", "score": 36, "author": "a_m_yxz", "created_utc": "2025-05-22 09:51:34", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ksvnv5/homeless_shoplifters/", "num_comments": 38, "permalink": "https://reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ksvnv5/homeless_shoplifters/", "selftext": "So ive been dealing with the same shop lifter for the past month.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted.

I work on a very busy street in South Florida that is absolutely filled with homeless people. First off, this is not a post hating on homeless people. I feel so deeply about how awful this situation is for them but at this point I am exhausted coming to work. We have been actively losing customers due to reviews and comments like: \u201cgreat coffee shop, awesome workers but there are tons of homeless people with their feet up outside smoking and drinking\u201d. Every day I open I have to kick people off the chairs from sleeping there so I can put out the chair cushions. They leave trash, beer, their actual belongs, food, throw up, and so much more. I am getting paid minimum wage btw. The other day people were literally smoking cra*k outside. I am a women who truly could not win a fight with them (I have been threatened). We have been instructed to contact non emergency to have them removed but they run from them and then we can\u2019t trespass them. Every worker at our shop has been harassed. Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane. We are in the process of having a meeting with the city set up with the city. I am so sick of coming to work and having to deal with this. There are so many things I didn\u2019t mention. This is not only a daily issue but happens multiple times during my single shift, yesterday I called the cops once and non emergency once as well as having to kick out more than 5 people. \n\nIf any business owners have any advice that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nEdit- I am in college. I also really enjoy this job besides the homelessness issue, everyone is telling me to look for a different place to work. If this does not change, I will 100% be looking to work at a different place. But for now I want to be a part of that change as I really enjoy this business and the community it stands for.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

They've served us well but with the rise in AI we may need to make a few adjustments. One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue. (I had bunches of comments reported 180 times each in a few minutes after I challenged a Reddit post removal company while defending one post).\n\nWe'd welcome your comments and criticism.

I am getting paid minimum wage btw. The other day people were literally smoking cra*k outside. I am a women who truly could not win a fight with them (I have been threatened). We have been instructed to contact non emergency to have them removed but they run from them and then we can\u2019t trespass them. Every worker at our shop has been harassed. Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane.

I had to hire a payroll restoration team and a CPA to fix everything and I\u2019m already $3k deep in cleanup costs.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve talked to their customer service over 30 times in the last 6 months. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s always someone in another country who has no idea what I\u2019m talking about.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

I now make roughly $2,000 per month by giving two tours on the weekends, and my tours are often fully booked (max out at 20 walkers) before the weekend arrives.\n\nWhat I've come to understand is that there is a lot of unmet demand for walking tours in my city, and I want to be able to expand to meet this demand.  I've also learned more about the business and can be a better provider.\n\nHere are my thoughts:\n\n* Offer the tour on more days, by hiring a subcontractor, including weekdays (when I'm at my day job and can't give the tours).  How do I find a good tour guide?  How do I train him?  What is a good pay model if he's going to be earning money from tips?\n* Offer private tours and for corporate clients.  How do I get corporate clients?  How do I advertise for private tours?\n* Offer upsells and add-ons to my free tours.  I have been trying to brainstorm things that are not gimmicky or lame.

The parameters in which a business qualifies for SBA acquisition loan are very strict. \n\nBusiness with SBA-approved valuations simply do not exist in the markets I\u2019ve seen. This was stated by the SBA broker as well. You must either get seller financing/standby/outside investment/gift from a family member (my favorite) for the remaining gap in valuation. \n\nIn addition to this, you need additional working capital post-acquisition. Payroll, repairs, improvements, etc all still need to be done.

They've served us well but with the rise in AI we may need to make a few adjustments. One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue. (I had bunches of comments reported 180 times each in a few minutes after I challenged a Reddit post removal company while defending one post).\n\nWe'd welcome your comments and criticism. Feel free to comment, we need the honest feedback and don't retailiate.\n\n*Edit: Sounds like voting is really going to matter even more going forward. If everyone votes post up or down as they see value I think we'll be in a good place. Personally I upvote every comment that adds value made in one of my posts whether I agree with them or not.

She has done this three times now.  The group she signs up with are a great bunch.  However, this woman has never actually come to a class.

The longest it has taken for me to get back to her is noon the next day after the missed class.  She knows my policy yet will ask what her options are and then blast me when I give her options to her:  my class is over priced, the project isn't worth the value, she heard the class ran over by 10 minutes (not due to me), I didn't have a wine stopper for their unused wine, etc.  This last time she stated that she is also a business owner and if I don't give her a refund she will \"escalate\" this and blast me on every social site that she can find.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue. (I had bunches of comments reported 180 times each in a few minutes after I challenged a Reddit post removal company while defending one post).\n\nWe'd welcome your comments and criticism. Feel free to comment, we need the honest feedback and don't retailiate.\n\n*Edit: Sounds like voting is really going to matter even more going forward. If everyone votes post up or down as they see value I think we'll be in a good place. Personally I upvote every comment that adds value made in one of my posts whether I agree with them or not.

I don't see these stores making any more money and I'm starting to wonder if I should throw in the towel soon. A lot of my friends are advancing in their careers, increasing their retirement funds, moving on up in life, etc.  I used to feel like I was the advanced one as a small business owner. But now I feel incredibly left behind. \n\nHas anyone else been at this crossroad? Im worried the longer I wait to pivot into another career, the harder it will get. On the other side, I could keep doing what I do and accept this is just my life. Not really sure what I'm expecting by posting here, just felt like I needed to express this. I'm in my mid 30s fwiw.

She has done this three times now.  The group she signs up with are a great bunch.  However, this woman has never actually come to a class.

The longest it has taken for me to get back to her is noon the next day after the missed class.  She knows my policy yet will ask what her options are and then blast me when I give her options to her:  my class is over priced, the project isn't worth the value, she heard the class ran over by 10 minutes (not due to me), I didn't have a wine stopper for their unused wine, etc.  This last time she stated that she is also a business owner and if I don't give her a refund she will \"escalate\" this and blast me on every social site that she can find.

Will keep you guys posted\n\nEdit 2: I was mostly just venting but i feel like i owe you all answers to these questions i\u2019ve been asked multiple times:\n\n1. What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue.

Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane. We are in the process of having a meeting with the city set up with the city. I am so sick of coming to work and having to deal with this. There are so many things I didn\u2019t mention. This is not only a daily issue but happens multiple times during my single shift, yesterday I called the cops once and non emergency once as well as having to kick out more than 5 people. \n\nIf any business owners have any advice that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nEdit- I am in college. I also really enjoy this job besides the homelessness issue, everyone is telling me to look for a different place to work. If this does not change, I will 100% be looking to work at a different place. But for now I want to be a part of that change as I really enjoy this business and the community it stands for.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue.

Every day I open I have to kick people off the chairs from sleeping there so I can put out the chair cushions. They leave trash, beer, their actual belongs, food, throw up, and so much more. I am getting paid minimum wage btw. The other day people were literally smoking cra*k outside. I am a women who truly could not win a fight with them (I have been threatened). We have been instructed to contact non emergency to have them removed but they run from them and then we can\u2019t trespass them. Every worker at our shop has been harassed. Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane. We are in the process of having a meeting with the city set up with the city. I am so sick of coming to work and having to deal with this. There are so many things I didn\u2019t mention.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

This is nearly impossible to find the appropriate deal without additional outside investment, bridge loans, or seller financing.\n\nTo start your own company, you are required to be exceptionally wealthy by modern standards to qualify. \n\nSo I\u2019m trying to understand, who is the SBA for? How do people start their own businesses with hardly any money?\n\nEdit for context:\n\nWhen I say \u201cexceptionally wealthy\u201d I am referring to the start up path of SBA where you are only able to loan on a 1:1 ratio of liquidity with a minimum of 100k. This is not possible for the average person looking to open their first small business.\n\nThe 10% down acquisition route, at first glance, seems not so bad. Until you look at what\u2019s for sale. The parameters in which a business qualifies for SBA acquisition loan are very strict. \n\nBusiness with SBA-approved valuations simply do not exist in the markets I\u2019ve seen. This was stated by the SBA broker as well. You must either get seller financing/standby/outside investment/gift from a family member (my favorite) for the remaining gap in valuation. \n\nIn addition to this, you need additional working capital post-acquisition. Payroll, repairs, improvements, etc all still need to be done. Yes, the acquired business will have cashflow on paper, but I think it\u2019s a bad idea to bank on that being there and no issues coming up.

They've served us well but with the rise in AI we may need to make a few adjustments. One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue. (I had bunches of comments reported 180 times each in a few minutes after I challenged a Reddit post removal company while defending one post).\n\nWe'd welcome your comments and criticism. Feel free to comment, we need the honest feedback and don't retailiate.\n\n*Edit: Sounds like voting is really going to matter even more going forward. If everyone votes post up or down as they see value I think we'll be in a good place. Personally I upvote every comment that adds value made in one of my posts whether I agree with them or not.

We have been instructed to contact non emergency to have them removed but they run from them and then we can\u2019t trespass them. Every worker at our shop has been harassed. Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane.

It rarely happens but I feel it is good customer service.  \n\nI have a customer that continues to sign up for my art classes but then cancels the day of, last time it was 30 mins before the class.  She has done this three times now.  The group she signs up with are a great bunch.  However, this woman has never actually come to a class.  She interrupts the class with calls & texts to those that are there, she demands to know \"what I am going to do for her\", each time, I specify I will contact her after class with options.  This woman is harassing to say the least.  \n\nShe will email, call, and text me until I get back to her.  The longest it has taken for me to get back to her is noon the next day after the missed class.  She knows my policy yet will ask what her options are and then blast me when I give her options to her:  my class is over priced, the project isn't worth the value, she heard the class ran over by 10 minutes (not due to me), I didn't have a wine stopper for their unused wine, etc.  This last time she stated that she is also a business owner and if I don't give her a refund she will \"escalate\" this and blast me on every social site that she can find.  Entitled is too light of a word to describe this woman.  \n\nEach time I have given a refund as I am hoping that she will never come back.  At this point, I am losing money.  Each time that a transaction goes through or I refund, the credit card company charges me a surcharge.  The last class was a customized project that she asked if the other women in the class or I could make for her.  There wasn't the time, each one took the entire class to complete their project and I charge extra if I do it as it would be my time outside of the class.  She got back to me with she \"will never do this project!\" and \"how dare\" I expect more money for me to complete her project on my \"already overpriced class!\".  So now I am eating the cost of these materials. This woman is a nightmare.  \n\nThis last time after the refund, she emailed me stating that she looks forward to coming in to complete the project that she had previously emailed that she \"will never do!\".  \n\nAnyone have a situation with a repeatedly bad customer?  What is the best way to handle this type of person?  I have already looked into it and there is no way for me to prevent her from signing up for the class.  I feel like I am being held hostage by this woman's threats.  I thought of reaching out to the organizer but as this is her friend, I think that would be unprofessional.  At this point, I don't mind if the group doesn't come back just so I don't have to deal with her but I don't think it is professional to ask them to not come back just because of her bad behavior.

What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue. (I had bunches of comments reported 180 times each in a few minutes after I challenged a Reddit post removal company while defending one post).\n\nWe'd welcome your comments and criticism. Feel free to comment, we need the honest feedback and don't retailiate.\n\n*Edit: Sounds like voting is really going to matter even more going forward. If everyone votes post up or down as they see value I think we'll be in a good place. Personally I upvote every comment that adds value made in one of my posts whether I agree with them or not.

I don't see these stores making any more money and I'm starting to wonder if I should throw in the towel soon. A lot of my friends are advancing in their careers, increasing their retirement funds, moving on up in life, etc.  I used to feel like I was the advanced one as a small business owner. But now I feel incredibly left behind. \n\nHas anyone else been at this crossroad? Im worried the longer I wait to pivot into another career, the harder it will get. On the other side, I could keep doing what I do and accept this is just my life. Not really sure what I'm expecting by posting here, just felt like I needed to express this. I'm in my mid 30s fwiw.

She has done this three times now.  The group she signs up with are a great bunch.  However, this woman has never actually come to a class.

The longest it has taken for me to get back to her is noon the next day after the missed class.  She knows my policy yet will ask what her options are and then blast me when I give her options to her:  my class is over priced, the project isn't worth the value, she heard the class ran over by 10 minutes (not due to me), I didn't have a wine stopper for their unused wine, etc.  This last time she stated that she is also a business owner and if I don't give her a refund she will \"escalate\" this and blast me on every social site that she can find.

Will keep you guys posted\n\nEdit 2: I was mostly just venting but i feel like i owe you all answers to these questions i\u2019ve been asked multiple times:\n\n1. What I do: I run an app marketing and development agency. \n\n2. Why are margins so low: I\u2019m in that weird spot where i have enough staff to handle more clients, but if i fire anybody i cant handle the clientele i have now, so i need to grow or scale down. Also in theory i do make 20% net, so i should make $300k this year, but i\u2019m factoring in black swan events that cost like $100k+ and are different every year. Nothings happened in 2025 yet. \n\n3. Can you cut expenses: Believe me i have. Overall expenses are half of what they were at the peak, mostly from outsourcing labor. And client retention is up, so no that isn\u2019t the issue. Revenue from the peak is down because my peak was covid and the world isn\u2019t like that anymore.\n\n4. Why don\u2019t you scale: My clientele have limited runway. If i don\u2019t close 2 new deals a months, my net clients drop on a monthly basis. This is expected from the niche i\u2019m in. It\u2019s not a great niche to be all in on. Its the reason why i grew so fast and then stagnated so hard. \n\n5. How are you going to scale: I\u2019m planning to merge other agencies into mine to expand. Or just sell it once i post a full year without a black swan.

One I'd like to implement is to enable mods to remove posts that do not add value to the sub but fill the queues and block out honest questions. Removals would be subject to strict rules to maintain subscriber control over content.\n\nUnder the new rule mods could remove posts even if they didn't violate other rules if they had both:\n\n1) A negative vote total\n2) Content focused on an overbroad question that has been asked before and doesn't benefit from updating or a question that does not seem to benefit small businesses\n\nExamples would be: what are your pain points, what small business do I do with $x, market research of the small business marketplace, would you use x tool, etc. \n\nAs a mod I am very careful about imposing my view of \"good content\" because opinions vary. I feel this rule is necessary to remove posts where the sub has designated low value (by voting them down) because they are still visible even at negative vote totals and AI or marketing practices have increased the frequency.\n\nObviously it is reasonable to wait some time before removing any post so early voting doesn't sink something good. We will also probably see attempts at vote/reporting manipulation - and we will respond to those with restorations, removals, bans, or stickies spending on what is attempted. I've suffered those both attacks myself so I know they are an issue.

Just the other day we have stopped giving free waters as well as no more public bathroom. The amount of times people have been doing dr*gs in our bathroom is insane. We are in the process of having a meeting with the city set up with the city. I am so sick of coming to work and having to deal with this. There are so many things I didn\u2019t mention. This is not only a daily issue but happens multiple times during my single shift, yesterday I called the cops once and non emergency once as well as having to kick out more than 5 people. \n\nIf any business owners have any advice that would be greatly appreciated. \n\n\nEdit- I am in college. I also really enjoy this job besides the homelessness issue, everyone is telling me to look for a different place to work. If this does not change, I will 100% be looking to work at a different place. But for now I want to be a part of that change as I really enjoy this business and the community it stands for.
